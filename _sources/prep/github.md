GitHub
=======================

During the workshops we will use GitHub as a common space to store data and scripts related to your project. GitHub is also an important tool for collaboration, project management and documentation.    

To access GitHub, you will need to create an account. Go to: https://github.com/join  

Once logged in, you can find our project's GitHub organization here: https://github.com/orgs/New-Languages-for-NLP/dashboard

You will also see a repository for your language team in the organization. 

You can use GitHub to create and edit new files in the browser.  Programmers frequently use the command line interface to push code from their personal computer to the shared repository.  GitHub allows us to manage conflicts between the individual copies and the common repository. You'll hear people refer to "commits", "pull requests" and "forking".  There's quite a bit of jargon and concepts. You can find a good introduction in the [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).   GitHub also offers a useful series of tutorials to help you get acclimated: https://guides.github.com/

If you're ever worried that you'll to the wrong thing, remember that Git versions everything, so we can always undo your changes if needed.
