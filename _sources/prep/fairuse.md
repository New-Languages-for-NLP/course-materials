Fair Use and Copyright
=======================

When building your training corpus, you will gather many types of texts from the Internet, from libraries, from existing linguistic resources and other places. We will tokenize and annotate these texts and eventually publish them as linguistic data. The creation of these datasets raises several important questions.  

- Have we gathered a diverse and representative collection of texts? Did we simply gather what was available, or did we follow a clear dataset development plan? 

- Is the process of data collection and curation documented? Could an outsider assess the provenance of your texts and how they were collected?

- Does your data violate copyright laws?  

There's no one good answer to this question and we encourage you to seek answers that are specific to the texts in your corpus, their authors, and the copyright laws specific to them. That said, it is common practice to omit sections of in-copyright materials such that it would be impossible to reconstruct the original work from your data. This might be, for example, the removal of a few words every 200 words. You can also choose to sample a certain percentage of the text. In the United States, less thant 10% of a work or no more than one chapter of a book is considered "fair use" for educational purposes. For more specific suggestions, there is a helpful chapter on copyright in [Corpus-Based Language Studies: An Advanced Resource Book](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/projects/corpus/ZJU/xCBLS/chapters/A09.pdf). 

## Corpus Documentation

Your corpus could easily contain text from hundreds of different texts. You're not likely to remember the specifics, so we recommend recording certain information each time you add a new text to the corpus. In the long term, this data will give you the means to manage the kinds of texts that are in the corpus. If a copyright violation notice appears in your inbox, you'll have good answers to address their concerns. 

1. Provenance of the text
    - Where the text was found and how it was accessed (for example, were university credentials used to access the materials?)  
    - The original format of the text (PDF, image, HTML)
    - How the text was collected (downloaded, requested, emailed...)

2. Rights and licenses of the text
    - Is the text in the [public domain](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/) or in copyright? 
    - For books published after 1975, you can search the [Library of Congress copyright database](http://cocatalog.loc.gov.)

3. Sampling and processing of the text
   - What portion of the original text was added to the corpus? 
   - Were any sampling or deletion techniques used? 

 
Finally, there is an entire NEH institute dedicated to legal literacies for text mining. Further information on the institute can be found [here](https://buildinglltdm.org/).
