Cadet the Notebook
=======================

The Cadet application offers a convenient wrapper over spaCy to help with new language development. However, some users prefer a more direct engagement with the code and are more comfortable working in a Jupyter notebook. For you, there is a notebook version of Cadet that can be run locally or in Google Colab. Note that Colab containers are not persistent and that you will lose any data and files that you do not export during the session.  

1. For Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/New-Languages-for-NLP/cadet-the-notebook/blob/main/New_Language.ipynb)

2. To run locally
    - `git clone https://github.com/New-Languages-for-NLP/cadet-the-notebook`
    - `cd cadet-the-notebook`, activate a virtual environment and then `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - `jupyter notebook`
