Python
=======================

What you need to know about Python for the workshops. 

- Google everything. You're almost always asking answered questions.

- Use Google and/or [Kite](https://www.kite.com/) to find example implementations of code. Feel free to borrow and adapt shared examples.

- Read the Docs. Seek good documentation and you will find good code.

- How to read Python error messages
  - Read from the bottom up
  - Look for the [type of error](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/exceptions) (such as SyntaxError, ImportError)
  - Find the first line that has code that you've written
  - What was the last change made before it broke? If you undo it, do you still get the error?
  - Do your dependencies have unmet dependencies?

- How to read [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tour)
  - Is this the exact same error or something similar?
  - When were the problem and solutions posted?
  - Skim for code blocks and commands.
  - The best answer may be in the comments
  - The answer that you need may not have the most up votes
   

- Persistence pays 
  - When you're not able to get something to work, keep at it, try new things, but keep at it until you fix the problem. 

- Sometimes persistence means finding an alternative path.  If the road is really blocked ahead, finding a route around is the only way forward.
